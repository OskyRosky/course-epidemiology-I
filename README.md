# Epidemiology I – Foundations of Statistical Analysis in Health Sciences

## 1. Course Overview

Epidemiology I is an introductory course focused on the statistical foundations required for epidemiological analysis in health sciences. The course provides students with the essential tools to understand, analyze, and interpret quantitative and qualitative data commonly used in public health, clinical research, and epidemiological studies.

The course emphasizes statistics as a core instrument for evidence-based health decision-making, supporting research, professional practice, and policy analysis in health-related fields.

## 2. Course Objectives

The primary objective of this course is to equip students with the conceptual and practical statistical knowledge necessary to understand epidemiological data and health research findings.

Specifically, the course aims to:

	•	Introduce statistics as a fundamental discipline in epidemiology and health sciences.
	•	Develop familiarity with basic statistical concepts and terminology.
	•	Apply descriptive statistics to summarize health-related data.
	•	Introduce probability theory as a foundation for epidemiological inference.
	•	Understand inferential statistical methods used in health research.
	•	Prepare students for advanced courses in epidemiology and biostatistics.

## 3. Statistical Foundations in Epidemiology

The course begins by establishing the statistical groundwork required for epidemiological reasoning:

	•	Definition and scope of statistics in health sciences.
	•	Brief history of statistics and its relevance to epidemiology.
	•	Main areas of statistical application in health and medicine.
	•	Classification of statistical data and variables:
	•	Quantitative and qualitative variables.
	•	Measurement scales and units of analysis.
	•	Population and sample concepts in health studies.
	•	Data collection methods:
	•	Observational data
	•	Experimental designs
	•	Sampling techniques

This foundation ensures students understand how epidemiological data is generated and structured.

## 4. Descriptive Statistics and Data Presentation

A major component of the course focuses on summarizing and presenting health data:

	•	Relative numbers and the need for data summarization.
	•	Ratios, proportions, and percentages in epidemiology.
	•	Common epidemiological indicators.
	•	Frequency distributions.
	•	Tabular presentation of data.
	•	Graphical representation of health information:
	•	Bar charts
	•	Pie charts
	•	Other graphical formats
	•	Measures of central tendency:
	•	Mean
	•	Median
	•	Mode
	•	Measures of variability:
	•	Range
	•	Variance
	•	Standard deviation
	•	Interpretation of distribution symmetry and skewness.

These tools allow students to transform raw health data into interpretable epidemiological information.

## 5. Probability and Epidemiological Inference

The course introduces probability as a key pillar of epidemiology:

	•	Concept of probability and uncertainty in health outcomes.
	•	Events and sample spaces.
	•	Definitions and interpretations of probability.
	•	Discrete and continuous probability distributions.
	•	Normal distribution and standard normal curve.
	•	Standardization and its epidemiological applications.
	•	Use of probability distributions in real-world health scenarios.

Students learn how probability supports risk assessment and population-level inference.

## 6. Inferential Statistics in Health Research

Inferential statistics are introduced as the bridge between samples and populations:

	•	Concept of statistical inference.
	•	Estimation methods:
	•	Point estimation
	•	Interval estimation
	•	Hypothesis testing:
	•	Steps of hypothesis testing
	•	Test statistics
	•	Interpretation of p-values
	•	Comparison of means and proportions.
	•	Introduction to analysis of variance (ANOVA).
	•	Correlation and bivariate regression analysis.
	•	Introduction to non-parametric statistical methods:
	•	When and why they are used
	•	Advantages and limitations
	•	Common non-parametric tests.

These methods are framed within epidemiological and health research contexts.

## 7. Teaching Methodology and Learning Approach

The course follows a theory–practice integrated methodology:

	•	Theoretical sessions introduce statistical concepts.
	•	Practical exercises reinforce learning through applied examples.
	•	Assignments focus on health-related and epidemiological datasets.
	•	Active student participation is encouraged to strengthen understanding.

Examples and exercises are designed to reflect real epidemiological problems, highlighting the relevance of statistics in health sciences.
